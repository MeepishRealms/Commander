![Commander](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MeepishRealms/Commander/main/banner.svg)
A balancing and quality-of-life behavior pack for Minecraft Bedrock.
All-in-one backend to power community survival PVP Minecraft servers.

Here's a few things that Commander does:
- Powers series defining features like the world border.
- Adds quality-of-life recipes like unpacking ice.
- Adds recipes to previously uncraftable items like saddles.
- Balances progression by changing certain recipes like Enchanting Tables.
- Adds ways to obtain previously unobtainable blocks like Glowing Obsidian.

All code and commits are open source and fully auditable.
The version currently active on the MECA Minecraft server always corresponds to the [latest](https://github.com/MeepishRealms/Commander/releases/latest) version.

Please note that some commits may not have been pushed onto the server yet and are subject to change, so make sure to always check the latest release tag, not the latest main branch commits. (Unless you're trying to get some sneak peeks!)
